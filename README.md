In this repository there are all the deliverables (6) for the software engineering group project at UniTn.<br>
The D1 is a description we created about an application and another group had to work on it.<br>
We had to work on the project ideated by the group G11 (we were the G12), called "SmartFit", so all the deliverables but the D1 are about it.<br>

The D5 is not all in this repository, we had to create a repository for the API development part to send to our professors, it can be found <a href="https://github.com/StellaDaniele/G12-software-engineering">here</a>.

### Work distribution in hours
| Members                           |  D1  |  D2  |  D3  |  D 4 |  D5  | D6  | TOTAL|
| --------------------------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | --- | ---- |
| Daniele Stella (team leader)      | 18.7 | 15.7 | 18.3 |  24  | 47.5 |  2  |  125 |
| Alessio Blascovich                | 8.25 |  4.5 |  9.8 | 12.5 |  22  | 2.7 |   60 |

The table above contains the data from the log, so it isn't 100% accurate since David and Alessio sometimes forgot to compile it. In any case, it somewhat gives an idea of the general distribution.
